# Bill of Materials
 * CUI SDS-80J (CP-2380-ND)
 * TE AMP 1-1734530-1 (A35116-ND)
 * 3x 150-ohm resistors

# Assembly directions
 1. Solder both connectors to the board. The top side is the one marked with the LeadedSolder URL and the board name.
 2. Solder three 150Ω resistors into the spots for them in the middle of the board (Red, Green, Blue). The footprint is slightly too small for normal resistors, so I had to stand the resistor straight up and bend the other lead over.
 3. Connect the computer to the female DIN with a DIN8 extension cable such as the Ancable male-male 270° DIN8 cable (for Peavey Sanpera guitar pedals)
 4. Connect a 15/24kHz-capable VGA monitor (I use an NEC MultiSync 1970NX) to the female VGA connector with a standard VGA monitor cable.
